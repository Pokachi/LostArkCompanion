  "description": "<span style=\"color: #FFEC50\">Darons learn from an early age not only to own a weapon, but also to take care of it. However, their blades often break due to the poor quality of Feyton steel. Broken swords and daggers are melted down, because sometimes even the fighters of the Avesta cannot afford new weapons.<br><br><span style=\"color: #FFEC50\">Violet and Reinare would love this.</span>",
